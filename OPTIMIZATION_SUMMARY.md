const char GPRS_APN[] = "zonginternet";
const char GPRS_LOGIN[] = "";
const char GPRS_PASSWORD[] = "";

// ThingSpeak Configuration
const char WRITE_API_KEY[] = "POWWNFLAIARHZL10";
const char READ_API_KEY[] = "43F8VBLWVJP4Y2FN";
const char CHANNEL_ID[] = "455094";

// Timeout Settings
const unsigned long CONNECTION_TIMEOUT = 30000;
const unsigned long COMMAND_TIMEOUT = 5000;
const unsigned long DATA_TIMEOUT = 10000;
```
