# MKR1400-Nust
This work was done as part of "Autonomous 11kV Distribution Line Fault localization System"
project funded by USAID at [USPCAS-E](https://uspcase.nust.edu.pk/) under the guidance of
Dr. Arsalan Habib Khawaja.

* The main objective of the project was to develop a non-contact magnetic-field measurement
system with wireless sensor unit for data collection and fault localization within the fault
span. Particularly, the research will be focused on developing an autonomous and portable
wireless smart sensor device to be deployed at various nodes of power distribution network.
